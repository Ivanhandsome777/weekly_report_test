    <h2>Macro Events</h2>
    <h3>Long Term Macro Narrative: 2025 H2 Crypto Bull Market Anchored by US Rate Cut Cycle and Institutional Accumulation</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Rationale:</strong><br>
        Over the past week, the dominant and recurring macro narrative is the crystallization of a new, multi-month crypto bull market, fundamentally anchored by (1) the imminent start of the US Federal Reserve’s rate cut cycle and (2) unprecedented institutional accumulation of core crypto assets, especially via ETFs. This narrative is reinforced by persistent, high-probability signals of a September Fed rate cut (market-implied probability consistently &gt;85%), record-breaking inflows into ETH and BTC spot ETFs, and a visible shift in corporate and fund treasury strategies toward aggressive crypto allocation—often at multiples of new supply.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Key Evidence and Logic Chain:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fed Rate Cut Cycle as Structural Catalyst:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The probability of a September rate cut has remained above 85% for two weeks, with dovish Fed commentary and softening labor/inflation data.</li>
                    <li>This is driving a global risk-on rotation, with crypto as a high-beta beneficiary.</li>
                    <li>The end of the hiking cycle and the start of easing is a classic multi-month tailwind for all risk assets, but especially for crypto, which is highly sensitive to liquidity and real rates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Accumulation Outpacing Supply:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>ETF inflows (ETH and BTC) are at historic highs: ETH spot ETF inflows have reached $10B+ in weeks, and BTC ETF inflows are consistently outpacing new mining supply by 4x.</li>
                    <li>Corporate treasuries and funds are accumulating BTC/ETH at a rate far above issuance, with on-chain data showing new highs in large-holder addresses and a sharp drop in exchange balances.</li>
                    <li>New ETF applications (e.g., for DOT, ADA) signal further broadening of institutional access and demand.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory and Adoption Tailwinds:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The US government is moving toward on-chain GDP data and stablecoin legislation, further legitimizing the sector and reducing regulatory overhang.</li>
                    <li>CFTC and SEC are providing more clarity, and global regulatory frameworks (e.g., Hong Kong, EU) are converging toward acceptance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market Structure and Flows:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite short-term profit-taking (e.g., $4B BTC whale sell), the structural flows are net positive and any dips are being aggressively bought by institutions.</li>
                    <li>ETF outflows are episodic and dwarfed by the scale of new inflows and corporate accumulation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Implications for Crypto Exchange Core Trading Business:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Directional Bias:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The next 3-6 months are structurally bullish for crypto, with high conviction.</li>
                    <li>The market is transitioning from a choppy, event-driven regime to a liquidity-driven, institutionally anchored bull market.</li>
                    <li>Short-term volatility and profit-taking are noise within a clear uptrend.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Market Character:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expect a sustained bull market (“牛市”) with periodic sharp pullbacks (as whales take profit or as technicals reset), but with each dip met by institutional demand.</li>
                    <li>Altcoin and DeFi sectors will see secondary flows as the “ETF effect” broadens and risk appetite increases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Critical Risks:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only credible bear scenario in the next 3-6 months would be a Fed policy reversal (e.g., inflation re-acceleration), a major regulatory shock, or a systemic crypto failure (none of which are currently visible in the data).</li>
                    <li>Short-term technical corrections are likely, but do not alter the core macro thesis.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="summary">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The dominant macro narrative is the start of a new, multi-month crypto bull market, structurally underpinned by the Fed’s imminent rate cut cycle and unprecedented institutional accumulation via ETFs and corporate treasuries. This is a high-conviction, high-impact regime shift that will drive sustained upside and volume for core trading business, with only episodic volatility as a counterpoint. The risk is being out of the market, not in it.

    <h3>I. Event: US Labor Market Data &amp; Fed Policy Uncertainty</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>The upcoming US labor market data (JOLTs, NFP, jobless claims) is the single most important macro catalyst for global risk assets, including crypto. The market is hypersensitive to any deviation from consensus, as labor data now directly informs the Fed’s rate path and liquidity outlook.</li>
            <li>Both traditional and crypto markets are already exhibiting elevated volatility as participants position ahead of these releases. A negative surprise (weaker jobs, higher unemployment) could trigger a sharp risk-off move, while a strong print may delay rate cut expectations and pressure crypto valuations.</li>
            <li>The Fed’s September FOMC outlook remains highly uncertain. Mixed or flawed labor data will further muddy the policy picture, increasing the uncertainty premium and likely resulting in whipsaw price action for BTC, ETH, and altcoins.</li>
            <li>For Bybit, this environment is likely to drive a surge in trading volumes and derivatives activity, but also raises the risk of sudden liquidations and short-term dislocations, especially if macro data surprises are large.</li>
            <li>The market’s posture is highly reactive; a clear labor market signal will set the tone for risk assets and dictate capital flows into or out of crypto in the coming weeks.</li>

    <h3>II. Event: Persistent Inflation &amp; Global CPI Divergence</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Recent CPI data from the US and other major economies confirm that inflation remains sticky, with core inflation above central bank targets. This sustains the “higher-for-longer” rates narrative, constraining central banks’ ability to cut and dampening risk-on sentiment.</li>
            <li>For crypto, this means a less favorable macro backdrop: higher real yields and a strong USD typically suppress speculative flows and spot trading volumes, as both institutional and retail traders reduce leverage and risk.</li>
            <li>However, persistent inflation also erodes fiat purchasing power, which could reinforce the “digital gold” narrative for Bitcoin and select altcoins over the medium term, especially if macro uncertainty abates.</li>
            <li>Regional CPI divergences (e.g., higher inflation in EMs vs. moderating in DMs) may drive cross-border capital flows and arbitrage, impacting liquidity and volatility on global trading platforms.</li>

    <h3>III. Event: Fed Rate Cut Signaling &amp; Policy Uncertainty</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>The Fed is signaling potential rate cuts starting as early as September 2025, with a multi-step easing cycle projected by both futures and major banks. This is a clear pivot in US monetary policy, driven by labor market weakness and contained inflation.</li>
            <li>However, the market remains divided on the pace and depth of cuts, and Fed officials’ public statements are increasingly divergent. This introduces volatility risk around FOMC meetings and macro data releases, amplifying short-term trading volumes and price swings on Bybit.</li>
            <li>Persistent uncertainty about the Fed’s reaction function means that macro-driven narrative shifts will remain a dominant driver of crypto market direction. This environment favors volatility and momentum strategies, which are core to Bybit’s trading business.</li>
            <li>Mortgage rates are expected to remain elevated in the near term, only gradually declining. This slow transmission of monetary easing may delay a broad-based risk asset rally, but also extends the window for macro-driven trading opportunities.</li>

    <h3>IV. Event: Geopolitical Tensions &amp; Trade Disruptions</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Escalating geopolitical tensions (Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, trade disputes) are introducing persistent uncertainty and volatility across global markets. This environment is likely to drive increased demand for non-sovereign, cross-border assets such as crypto, as investors seek alternatives to traditional financial instruments exposed to geopolitical risk.</li>
            <li>Trade disruptions and protectionist policies are forcing corporates to adapt, potentially accelerating the adoption of stablecoins and crypto rails for cross-border settlements—directly benefiting crypto exchange transaction flows.</li>
            <li>Central banks’ inclination to tighten in response to inflation (partly driven by geopolitical risk) may pressure risk assets in the short term, but if fiat volatility or capital flight intensifies, crypto could see renewed inflows as an alternative store of value.</li>

            <li>The VIX has spiked sharply in recent sessions, but the broader volatility regime remains historically muted. This suggests episodic risk-off flows rather than a structural shift in market sentiment.</li>
            <li>For crypto, this typically translates to brief surges in trading activity and liquidity as traders hedge or reposition, but not necessarily a sustained trend change.</li>
            <li>Unless the VIX sustains elevated levels or is followed by macro catalysts (e.g., Fed surprises, geopolitical shocks), the impact on Bybit’s core trading business is likely to be transient.</li>

        <strong>Summary Judgment:</strong> The US labor market data and Fed policy trajectory are the dominant macro variables for crypto in the near term. The market is hypersensitive to any surprises, and volatility is likely to remain elevated as traders position around these events. Persistent inflation and global CPI divergence reinforce the “higher-for-longer” narrative, capping risk appetite but supporting the long-term case for crypto as fiat purchasing power erodes. Geopolitical risk and trade disruptions are a structural tailwind for crypto adoption, but also increase short-term volatility and regulatory risk. For Bybit, this is an environment of high opportunity and high risk: trading volumes and derivatives activity will remain robust, but risk management and real-time macro monitoring are critical as single data prints can drive multi-billion dollar flows in minutes.

        <strong>Summary &amp; Trends:</strong> Global regulation is rapidly moving toward harmonized, strictly enforced frameworks, focusing on stablecoins and centralized trading venues. The three most important developments for Bybit are: (1) the U.S. GENIUS Act—establishing a regulated, federally supervised stablecoin environment; (2) the EU’s MiCA regime—mandating harmonized requirements for all crypto providers and enforcing strict stablecoin rules; (3) U.S. regulatory momentum toward granting CFTC clear spot market authority, which signals a coming era of regulated spot crypto trading and material compliance uplift for all market participants.

        <strong>Core Trading Recommendations (Flagged &amp; Forward-Looking):</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Short-term: Stay Defensive, Trade the Trend.</strong> The market is in a risk-off phase, with major coins (BTC, ETH, SOL) showing clear bearish momentum. Do not attempt to catch falling knives—trend-following shorts or flat positioning are favored until clear reversal signals emerge.</li>
            <li><strong>WLFI: Only for High-Conviction, Nimble Traders.</strong> WLFI is the epicenter of speculation, but the risk of post-unlock dump and whale games is extremely high. If trading, use tight stops and monitor on-chain flows obsessively. For most, best to avoid until after major unlocks and volatility subside.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlock Events: Avoid Pre-Unlock Exposure.</strong> Large unlocks (WLFI, DYDX, ENA) are likely to trigger further downside or volatility spikes. Only consider buying after unlock-induced capitulation, not before.</li>
            <li><strong>DeFi/Alt L1: Wait for Macro Stabilization.</strong> Solana, Kava, Lista DAO, etc. have strong fundamentals and innovation, but are not immune to broad market risk-off. Accumulate only after market-wide sentiment improves.</li>
            <li><strong>Macro: Watch for Fed Surprises, But Don’t Front-Run.</strong> Macro events (rate cuts, NFP) are the only potential bullish catalysts. Until then, expect choppy, low-liquidity trading. Stay patient and keep powder dry for post-event opportunities.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> This is a market for disciplined, tactical traders—not for hero calls or blind dip-buying. Stay short or flat, avoid pre-unlock exposure, and only engage with meme/speculative plays (WLFI) if you have a clear edge and risk controls. Wait for macro or post-unlock capitulation before considering aggressive longs.

    <h2>Competitor Report</h2>
    <div class="summary">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The most significant competitive threats to Bybit currently stem from: (1) Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp, which accelerates global regulatory expansion and institutional competition; (2) Gate.io’s rapid surge in derivatives/spot volumes and aggressive fiat on/off-ramp and product innovation, directly challenging Bybit’s core user segments; (3) Coinbase’s expansion into Bitcoin-backed lending and rapid monetization of market trends, strengthening its institutional and product edge; (4) Crypto.com’s high-profile partnership with Trump Media, which could catalyze a major US user and liquidity shift; and (5) Bank of China Hong Kong’s entry into stablecoins, signaling a new phase of institutional competition in regulated digital assets. Each of these actions has the potential to materially impact Bybit’s revenue, market share, or long-term brand positioning.

            <li>Bitstamp’s MAS license and hiring spree in Asia signal a coordinated push into APAC, directly challenging Bybit’s regional growth and user base.</li>
            <li>The combination of Robinhood’s brand, user base, and Bitstamp’s regulatory assets creates a formidable competitor as the market shifts toward institutionalization and compliance, potentially eroding Bybit’s market share in both developed and emerging markets.</li>

        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Gate.io’s 44% MoM surge in derivatives volume and 66% increase in spot volume signal a major gain in market share, threatening Bybit’s position among both retail and institutional traders.</li>
            <li>Aggressive expansion of fiat on/off-ramp (VISA/Mastercard, 36+ currencies) and new VIP asset management products directly target high-value and mainstream users, narrowing the gap with top-tier exchanges.</li>
            <li>Product innovation (AI-driven risk controls, SocialFi, copy trading, stablecoin programs) increases user stickiness and raises industry standards, pressuring Bybit to accelerate its own ecosystem and risk management upgrades.</li>
            <li>High-profile token launches (e.g., Trump’s WLFI) and stablecoin initiatives further boost Gate.io’s visibility and liquidity, especially in the USDT segment.</li>

    <h3>V. Competitors Action: Bank of China Hong Kong Applies for Stablecoin Issuer License, Signaling Institutional Entry into Regulated Digital Assets</h3>
    <div>
        <strong>Key Insights:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Bank of China Hong Kong’s move into stablecoins marks a new phase of institutional competition, likely to accelerate adoption and trust in fiat-backed digital assets.</li>
            <li>This could draw users and liquidity away from crypto-native stablecoins and exchanges, including Bybit, especially as regulatory clarity and institutional credibility become more important.</li>

        <strong>Critical Note:</strong> Other competitor actions (e.g., Binance whale inflows, KuCoin’s Thailand expansion, OKX’s tokenomics, Bitget’s Asia growth, Kraken’s AI trading push) are notable but do not currently meet the threshold for moderate or greater short-term revenue/market share threat or long-term industry impact compared to the above. They should be monitored but are not prioritized for immediate strategic response.
